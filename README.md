## Favorite series: Cells at work!

### What is that series?

**It is an anime series *(for those who do not know, it's a style of animation from Japan)* based on the manga of the same name.**
**The anime was created by David Production and it has two seasons.**

### The setting and plot
anthropomorphic
: Having human attributes (Human form, intellect, others humans have)

> The series is set on a human body, where the human cells are replaced with anthropomorphic equivalents.
  The series revolves around a certain rookie red blood cell who try to do her job, but unfortunately
  incidents get in her way, from something as trivial as a bacterial infection to relatively
  apocalyptic[^1] such as hemorrhagic shock.
> 
> However, there are some cells that help her life better, and to keep the body alive, 
  such as the white blood cell and macrophages, immune cells that kill pathogens, and
  platelets that patch up wounds or openings that cause bleeding.

[^1]: in this case, her and more than 30 million cells' world which is our bodies.

### Characters or Cell-Humans
**Blood cells and protagonists**
- AE3803 (Red blood cell)
- U-1146 (Neutrophil)
- Platelets

**Immune cells**
- Neutrophils in general
- Macrophage
- T-cells (there are a lot of types. Killer T-cells, Helper T-Cells, Naive T-Cell)
- Dendritic cells
- B-Cells (produces antibodies)
- Basophil and Eosinophil
- Memory Cell

### Why it's my favorite series 
The series not only gives me a simplified look into how our human bodies work,
but it also give us a perspective that our bodies are like our own countries,
composed of trillions of cell-citizens that work to keep us alive, with the
immune cells as an army of the body.

### Other facts:
> There is a spin-off anime series which is called Cells at Work!: Code Black
  The spin-off anime series is set on a different body, albeit in a darker
  time.[^2]
  
[^2]:In this case, the body is experiencing unhealthy lifestyle and at risk of worse diseases such as blood clots.
